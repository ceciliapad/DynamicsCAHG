# DynamicsCAHG

This repository contains the data and code to reproduce the analyses reported in **Padilla-Iglesias et al. 2022** "Population inter-connectivity over the past 120,000 years explains distribution and diversity of Central African hunter-gatherers" publised in **PNAS** and available [here](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2113936119)

## Contents:

**Data files:**

- Data S1: Size and approximate location of camps
- Data S2: Location and dating of hunter-gatherer archaeological sites 
- Data S3: Location and dating of initial 14C date compilation 

**Code files:**

- Present_SDM: Code used for modelling distribution, density and connectivity of Hunter-Gatherers across Central Africa.
- Past_validation: Code used for projecting present ENM to the past, extracting past predictions of distribution and density of CAHG and validating past predictions with CAHG archaeological assemblages.

**Additional files:**

- Biome_plots_cores: Plots of biome distribution in our area of study every 1,000 or 2,000 time slices according to [Beyer et al. 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0552-1)
